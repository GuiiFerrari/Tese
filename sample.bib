In this work, few algorithms beyond RANSAC were successfully tested using experimental data taken with the AT-TPC, ACTAR and TexAT detectors. The present tracking algorithm has a better inlier-outlier detection than the simple sequential RANSAC routine. Modifications in the random sampling and clustering were included to improve the tracking efficiency. Very good results were obtained in all the test cases, in particular for fitting short tracks in the detection limit."

This gas-filled detector uses an active-target design where the gas acts as both the tracking medium and the reaction target. Operating inside a 2T solenoidal magnetic field, the AT-TPC records charged particle tracks that can be reconstructed to very good energy and angular resolutions. The near-4π solid angle coverage and thick target of the detector are well-suited to experiments with low secondary beam intensities. In this paper, the design and instrumentation of theAT-TPC are described along with the methods used to analyze the data it produces. A simulation of the detector’s performance and some results from its commissioning with a radioactive 46Ar beam are also presented."

Ion back-flow in various gas detectors, mainly induced by the secondary ionization processes during amplification, has long been known as a source of drift field distortion. Here, we report on beam-induced space-charge effects from the primary ionization process in the drift region in low-energy nuclear physics experiment with Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC). A qualitative explanation of the observed effects is provided using detailed electron transport simulations. As ion mobility is a crucial factor in the space-charge effects, the need for a careful optimization of gas properties is highlighted. The impact of track distortion on tracking algorithm performance is also discussed.}

abstract={Big Data Analytics and Deep Learning are two high-focus of data science. Big Data has become important as many organizations both public and private have been collecting massive amounts of domain-specific information, which can contain useful information about problems such as national intelligence, cyber security, fraud detection, marketing, and medical informatics. Companies such as Google and Microsoft are analyzing large volumes of data for business analysis and decisions, impacting existing and future technology. Deep Learning algorithms extract high-level, complex abstractions as data representations through a hierarchical learning process. Complex abstractions are learnt at a given level based on relatively simpler abstractions formulated in the preceding level in the hierarchy. A key benefit of Deep Learning is the analysis and learning of massive amounts of unsupervised data, making it a valuable tool for Big Data Analytics where raw data is largely unlabeled and un-categorized. In the present study, we explore how Deep Learning can be utilized for addressing some important problems in Big Data Analytics, including extracting complex patterns from massive volumes of data, semantic indexing, data tagging, fast information retrieval, and simplifying discriminative tasks. We also investigate some aspects of Deep Learning research that need further exploration to incorporate specific challenges introduced by Big Data Analytics, including streaming data, high-dimensional data, scalability of models, and distributed computing. We conclude by presenting insights into relevant future works by posing some questions, including defining data sampling criteria, domain adaptation modeling, defining criteria for obtaining useful data abstractions, improving semantic indexing, semi-supervised learning, and active learning.},

In this work, we have developed and implemented a novel algorithm based on the Random Sample Consensus Model (RANSAC). The RANSAC is used to classify tracks including pile-up, to remove uncorrelated noise hits, as well as to reconstruct the vertex of the reaction. The algorithm, developed within the Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) framework, was tested and validated by analyzing the 4He+4He reaction. Results, performance and quality of the proposed algorithm are presented and discussed in detail."

The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters."

abstract = {A new method is presented for robustly estimating multiple view relations from point correspondences. The method comprises two parts. The first is a new robust estimator MLESAC which is a generalization of the RANSAC estimator. It adopts the same sampling strategy as RANSAC to generate putative solutions, but chooses the solution that maximizes the likelihood rather than just the number of inliers. The second part of the algorithm is a general purpose method for automatically parameterizing these relations, using the output of MLESAC. A difficulty with multiview image relations is that there are often nonlinear constraints between the parameters, making optimization a difficult task. The parameterization method overcomes the difficulty of nonlinear constraints and conducts a constrained optimization. The method is general and its use is illustrated for the estimation of fundamental matrices, image–image homographies, and quadratic transformations. Results are given for both synthetic and real images. It is demonstrated that the method gives results equal or superior to those of previous approaches.}}

In this review, which focuses on the application of CNNs to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art deep learning systems. Along the way, we analyze (1) their early successes, (2) their role in the deep learning renaissance, (3) selected symbolic works that have contributed to their recent popularity, and (4) several improvement attempts by reviewing contributions and challenges of over 300 publications.

abstract={Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

The positive ion signal has a duration of 100 ns. The fast evacuation of positive ions combined with the high granularity of the detector provide a high rate capability. Gas gains of up to 105 have been achieved.}

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

We tested binary and multi-class classification methods on data produced by the  46Ar(p,p) experiment run at the NSCL in September 2015. We found that fine-tuning a pre-trained convolutional neural network produced the most successful classifier of proton scattering events in the experimental data, when trained on both experimental and simulated data. We present results from this investigation and conclude with recommendations for event classification in future experiments.}

	abstract = {The distribution of electric charge in atomic nuclei is fundamental to our understanding of the complex nuclear dynamics and a quintessential observable to validate nuclear structure models.  The aim of this study is to explore a novel approach that combines sophisticated models of nuclear structure with Bayesian neural networks (BNN) to generate predictions for the charge radii of thousands of nuclei throughout the nuclear chart. A class of relativistic energy density functionals is used to provide robust predictions for nuclear charge radii. In turn, these predictions are refined through Bayesian learning for a neural network that is trained using residuals between theoretical predictions and the experimental data. Although predictions obtained with density functional theory provide a fairly good description of experiment, our results show significant improvement (better than 40\%) after BNN refinement. Moreover, these improved results for nuclear charge radii are supplemented with theoretical error bars. We have successfully demonstrated the ability of the BNN approach to significantly increase the accuracy of nuclear models in the predictions of nuclear charge radii. However, as many before us, we failed to uncover the underlying physics behind the intriguing behavior of charge radii along the calcium isotopic chain.}

abstract = {The automatic reconstruction of three-dimensional particle tracks from Active Target Time Projection Chambers data can be a challenging task, especially in the presence of noise. In this article, we propose a non-parametric algorithm that is based on the idea of clustering point triplets instead of the original points. We define an appropriate distance measure on point triplets and then apply a single-link hierarchical clustering on the triplets. Compared to parametric approaches like RANSAC or the Hough transform, the new algorithm has the advantage of potentially finding trajectories even of shapes that are not known beforehand. This feature is particularly important in low-energy nuclear physics experiments with Active Targets operating inside a magnetic field. The algorithm has been validated using data from experiments performed with the Active Target Time Projection Chamber developed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The results demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to identify and isolate particle tracks that describe non-analytical trajectories. For curved tracks, the vertex detection recall was 86\% and the precision 94\%. For straight tracks, the vertex detection recall was 96\% and the precision 98\%. In the case of a test set containing only straight linear tracks, the algorithm performed better than an iterative Hough transform.}

abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of “unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the “Vanilla LSTM”1 1The nickname “Vanilla LSTM” symbolizes this model’s flexibility and generality (Greff et al., 2015). network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.}

In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

Dedicated routines were developed to simulate the mechanism of direct reactions involving two and three particles in the final state. The present simulations were employed to investigate the feasibility of a Solenoidal Spectrometer with the RIBRAS facility. Our first results indicate that the concept can be applied in the RIBRAS system under certain conditions. Forthcoming studies both from simulations and experiments are already under development.},

The main objective of this algorithm is to make the analysis of experiments with active target time projection chambers more efficient. The code is divided in three steps: baseline correction, signal deconvolution and peak detection and integration. The CNNs were able to learn the signal processing models with relative errors of less than 6%. The analysis based on CNNs provides the same results as the traditional deconvolution algorithms, but considerably more efficient in terms of computing time (about 65 times faster). This opens up new possibilities to improve existing codes and to simplify the analysis of the large amount of data produced in active target experiments.}

abstract={The present status of fusion reactions involving light (A < 20) radioactive projectiles at energies around the Coulomb barrier (E < 10 MeV per nucleon) is reviewed, emphasizing measurements made within the last decade. Data on elastic scattering (providing total reaction cross section information) and breakup channels for the involved systems, demonstrating the relationship between these and the fusion channel, are also reviewed. Similarities and differences in the behavior of fusion and total reaction cross section data concerning halo nuclei, weakly-bound but less exotic projectiles, and strongly-bound systems are discussed. One difference in the behavior of fusion excitation functions near the Coulomb barrier seems to emerge between neutron-halo and proton-halo systems. The role of charge has been investigated by comparing the fusion excitation functions, properly scaled, for different neutron- and proton-rich systems. Possible physical explanations for the observed differences are also reviewed.},

abstract = {Angular distributions of the Coulomb breakup of radioactive 17F were measured by impinging a 10 MeV/nucleon beam on 208Pb and on 58Ni to study the dynamic polarization effects. The breakup products, oxygen and a proton, were detected in coincidence. First-order perturbation theory significantly overpredicts the breakup cross section for the 208Pb target. Dynamical calculations with a dynamic polarization as the leading order correction were performed. The calculations reproduce the data for 17F on 58Ni but overpredict the breakup of 17F on 208Pb by a factor of two at forward angles.}

It is shown that the reaction is dominated by elastic nuclear breakup (diffraction dissociation).}

abstract = {The mechanism of reactions with weakly-bound proton-rich nuclei at energies near the Coulomb barrier is a long-standing open question owing to the paucity of experimental data. In this study, a complete kinematics measurement was performed for the proton drip-line nucleus 17F interacting with 58Ni at four energies near the Coulomb barrier. Thanks to the powerful performance of the detector array, exhaustive information on the reaction channels, such as the differential cross sections for quasielastic scattering, exclusive and inclusive breakup, as well as for fusion-evaporation protons and alphas, was derived for the first time. The angular distributions of quasielastic scattering and exclusive breakup can be described reasonably well by the continuum-discretized coupled-channels calculations. The inclusive breakup was investigated using the three-body model proposed by Ichimura, Austern, and Vincent, and results indicate the non-elastic breakup is the dominant component. The total fusion cross sections were determined by the fusion-evaporation protons and alphas. Based on the measured exclusive breakup data, the analysis of the classical dynamical simulation code PLATYPUS demonstrates that the incomplete fusion plays a minor role. Moreover, compared with 16O+58Ni, both the reaction and total fusion cross sections of 17F+58Ni exhibit an enhancement in the sub-barrier energy region, which mainly arises from couplings to the continuum states. This work indicates that the information of full reaction channels is crucially important to comprehensively understand the reaction mechanisms of weakly bound nuclear systems.}
